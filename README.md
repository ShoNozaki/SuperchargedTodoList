# SuperchargedTodoList

Greenfield Check-in Deliverables:
- Team Roles
Sho: Product Owner
Kay: Scrum Master
Lewis + Howard: Dev team

- Product Idea
Website for sharing a day's worth of activity schedule with people.
For example, say you just had a really fun day in LA area: you've gone to Santa Monica beach in the morning, grabbed a drink at a trendy bar in downtown LA after, and dined out at a really cool joint somewhere in hollywood area.
Now you can list out all those activities and show them in a map so that you can share them with your friends!

Our app will try to make it easy for you to plot out exactly where you were and what you did and the total cost of all those activities so that maybe someone else can see your itinerary and give it a shot (or even tweak it to to suit their needs) 

- Tech Stack
Front end web rendering: Angular
DB management: Sequelize and Mongo?
Authorization: Oauth/sessions?
Map: Google API
